            <h1>A Short path on Helping the Poor and Needy People</h1>
            <p>This is a short essay on helping poor people so that they can live life intelligently and beautifully.
                Life is a matter of privilege because while some live a life of luxury, some just fail to even meet the
                ends of life.</p>

            <p>Donating would mean showing a sense of responsibility toward the betterment of the world. If you think
                that all the poverty and the problems would vanish through propaganda that is carried out by various
                organizations and governments, then you are not thinking in the right direction because propagandas are
                only ideas. In fact, you need to take the right action now.</p>

                The importance of earning halal sustenance is immense. In the Holy Qur’an, Allah says, ‘After the prayer
                is over, spread out on the earth and seek Allah’s grace; And remember Allah much, that you may be
                successful. '(Surah Jumu'ah: verse 10)
                The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, ‘No one ever eats better food than the
                food he has earned.’ (Saheeh Bukhari, 2072)</p>

            <p>
                The character of the weather is changing. The country is burning with the intensity of heat. We are witnessing the consequences of our own hands, including climate change and deforestation. To protect from this you need to plant a lot of trees. Realizing this need, the Foundation has taken up the plan of planting fruit trees across the country every year.</p>
